# Sorting Visualize

A web-based **Sorting Visualizer** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project provides an interactive interface to visualize and understand the process of various sorting algorithms in real-time.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: See the step-by-step process of sorting algorithms with animations.
- **Multiple Algorithms Supported**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Real-Time Updates**: Watch the sorting happen dynamically.
- **Customizable Array**: Users can generate arrays of different sizes and values.
- **Timer Functionality**: Measures algorithm execution time for comparison.
- **Intuitive UI**: Easy-to-use interface for better learning experience.
